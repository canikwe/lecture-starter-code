# OOJS and SPAs
- How can we use OOJS when building out Single Page Applications?

### Remember that Pokemon Teams lab?
- Image having an App class, a Trainer class, and a Pokemon class.

- We will create 1 instance of App when the DOM loads
- App will create 8 instances of Trainer
- Each Trainer will create many instance of Pokemon

App => Trainer => Pokemon

#### We have to make sure we pass the correct data to each instance!
