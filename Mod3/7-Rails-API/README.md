# Rails API
- Dynamic web pages with JS front end and Rails backend
- Single page application

### Why?
- Response with request for data with data (json)
- Manage large database (update/add rows)
- Use relationship between models

### Getting Started
`rails new --api <project_name>`

### Useful Rails Commands
- `rails g model cat`
- `rake db:migrate rake db:seed`
- `rails g controller cats`

### CORS
- Cross Origin Resource Sharing

### Serializers

##### Custom Serializers

##### Using a gem
- `rails g serializer cat`

### CRUD
 - We can Read
 - Let's now Create
 - How would we do Update or Delete?

### Improvements
- Validations
- Remove all relationships with delete resource

### Transition to Project Mode
- [Setting Up Your Mod 3 Project](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/mod3-project-week-setup-example)
- Before Project pitches, you must have your models drawn out and at least one wireframe of you project
