## Higher Order Functions and Functional Programming

### Take another function as a parameter
 - Callbacks
  - Let's make our own version of .map()
  - other examples of callbacks: setTimeout() and setInterval
  - allows for flexible and custom behavior

### Return a Function
 - Function Factories

### Nested Functions
 - Closures

### Run once and only once
- IIFEs (Immediately Invoked Function Expressions)

## Functional Programming (vs. Object Oriented Programming)
 - Pure Functions
 - Does not mutate state, affecting global variables or other parts of the program
 - Declarative code
 - Each function does one thing




## Announcement:
- Functional Programming Lab: start now, everyone should have their own fork/copy
- We are deploying more labs in after the paired labs on the DOM
  - There is a Lab called DOM Challenge that is listed as reading but is a Lab
  - Note: Konami Lab test cases don't work...
