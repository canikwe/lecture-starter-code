## Controlled Forms and Event Callback handlers
- State represent things on your DOM that can change 
- Forms are things on the DOM that can change

A good practice is to have all forms/inputs control state
 - and in turn, the state should control the form!
 - no more document.querySelector to get values because data is always in the state!




 

## On Your Own
- practice working with other input types (textarea, select, checkbox, radio button)
